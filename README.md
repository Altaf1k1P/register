# Usage

## Authentication
 1. Sign up with a new account.
 2. Log in with valid credentials.
 3. Access restricted features such as "Add Post" or "My Posts".
 4. Logout to secure your session.

## Responsive Design

 - On smaller screens, the navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu.
 - Open the menu to view navigation links and user-specific options.

## Future Enhancements:
- Server-Side Authentication: Integrate secure session handling.
- Role-Based Access Control: Restrict certain features based on user roles.
- Improved Error Handling: Add user-friendly messages for API and validation errors.
